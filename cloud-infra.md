Perfect — let’s put together a **comprehensive documentation** for your infrastructure project.
I’ll cover **architecture, each module, the design principles, CI considerations, and extensibility**.

# 📘 Infrastructure Documentation: `listservice`

## 1. Overview

The `listservice` infrastructure is built on **AWS ECS (Fargate)**, fronted by an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**, and deployed with **Terraform**.
It is designed to support a backend microservice with:

* Reliable networking (VPC, public/private subnets, NAT, IGW).
* Autoscaling ECS service behind an ALB.
* ECR for container image storage.
* CloudWatch for observability.
* Modularity for CI, staging, and production.

The design is **modular**, meaning each component (network, ALB, ECS, observability, etc.) is encapsulated in its own Terraform module.

## 3. Terraform Module Structure

Each module lives in `../../modules/` and is reusable across environments (`ci`, `staging`, `prod`).

### 🔹 `network`

* Creates:

  * VPC
  * Public subnets (for ALB / CI ECS tasks)
  * Private subnets (for production ECS tasks / DB)
  * Internet Gateway (IGW)
  * NAT Gateway (for private subnets in staging/prod)
  * Route tables

* Key outputs:

  * `vpc_id`
  * `public_subnet_ids`
  * `private_subnet_ids`

---

### 🔹 `alb`

* Creates:

  * Application Load Balancer (ALB)
  * Security group (allows HTTP/HTTPS)
  * Target group (port 8080, health checks)
  * Listener (HTTP → forward / redirect to HTTPS if enabled)

* Optional: HTTPS via ACM certificate (domain required).

* Key outputs:

  * `alb_dns`
  * `tg_arn`
  * `alb_sg_id`

---

### 🔹 `ecs`

* Creates:

  * ECS Cluster (with Container Insights)
  * IAM roles (task execution + task role)
  * ECS Task Definition (CPU/mem, container, env vars, logging to CloudWatch)
  * ECS Service (running tasks behind ALB)
  * Security group for ECS tasks
  * Autoscaling (CPU and optional ALB requests)

* Key outputs:

  * `cluster_name`
  * `service_name`
  * `task_definition_arn`
  * `service_sg_id`

---

### 🔹 `ecr`

* Creates:

  * ECR repository (container storage)
  * Lifecycle policies (retain N images, expire untagged after X days)
  * Optional registry-wide scanning

* Key outputs:

  * `ecr_repository_url`
  * `login_command` (for Docker push)

---

### 🔹 `autoscaling` (if used separately)

* Creates:

  * Autoscaling target
  * CPU utilization scaling policy
  * Request count scaling policy

* Used mainly in production; ECS module already integrates basic autoscaling.

---

### 🔹 `observability`

* Creates CloudWatch alarms:

  * ALB 5xx errors
  * ECS high CPU (>80%)
  * ECS running task count < 1
  * Optional: ALB latency, ALB 4xx

* Key outputs:

  * Alarm names/arns

---

## 4. CI Environment (`ci/`)

* **Simplified networking**: ECS tasks run in *public subnets* (no NAT needed).
* **HTTP-only**: ALB serves plain HTTP (since no domain).
* **Small scale**: `desired_count=1`, `min_capacity=1`, `max_capacity=2`.
* **Cheap**: No NAT, no HTTPS certs.
* **Outputs**:

  * `alb_dns` (endpoint to hit API)
  * `tg_arn` (debugging)

---

## 5. Staging / Production Differences

* ECS tasks run in **private subnets** with outbound via **NAT Gateway**.
* ALB has **HTTPS enabled** with ACM certificate + custom domain.
* Autoscaling enabled (CPU + request count).
* Observability alarms send to **SNS topic** (PagerDuty/Slack integration possible).

---

## 6. Security Considerations

* ALB SG allows traffic from `0.0.0.0/0` on HTTP/HTTPS.
* ECS Service SG allows only from ALB SG.
* IAM roles scoped to least-privilege policies (exec role = ECR + logs, task role = app-specific).
* ECR can use KMS encryption.
* Logs retained (default 14 days, configurable).

---

## 7. Costs (CI baseline)

* ECS (1 task, Fargate 256 CPU, 512 MB): **\~\$15/month**
* ALB: **\~\$20/month**
* VPC/NAT (CI = no NAT): **\$0**
* CloudWatch logs + metrics: **\~\$5/month**

➡️ \~ **\$40/month for CI** (very low).
Staging/prod with NAT + HTTPS + scaling = **\$100–150/month**.

---

## 8. Cleanup

A helper script `cleanup-ci.sh` force-deletes ECS services, ALBs, target groups, SGs, ENIs, and VPCs when `terraform destroy` doesn’t succeed.
This ensures no dangling resources remain.

---

## 9. Limitations

* No trusted HTTPS without a custom domain.
* No persistent database included (future module: RDS/ DynamoDB).
* CI intentionally insecure (public subnets, HTTP only).

---

✅ That’s the **overall design + module documentation**.
Would you like me to also produce a **README.md file (ready-to-use)** so this doc lives inside your repo?
